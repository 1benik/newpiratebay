Installation
---

1. Download the theme into the *openbay/www/themes* folder (next to the oldpiratebay),
2. Open the *openbay/protected/config/config.php* file,
3. Change *'theme' => 'oldpiratebay',* to *'theme' => 'newpiratebay',* on line 5,
4. Copy *npb_logo.png* to *openbay/www/img*,
5. Done.

Note
---

This is just a quick mockup, the new CSS code is inside the head.php file, a lot of code commented, the main page is hardcoded (the table) etc. It's messy :)
